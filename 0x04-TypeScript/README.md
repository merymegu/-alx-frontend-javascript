# 0x04. Typescript

## 📝 Project Overview

In this project, we will:

- ✨ Work with **TypeScript** types and interfaces.
- 🎨 Manipulate the DOM using TypeScript.
- 📚 Extend and merge declarations.
- 🏛️ Implement advanced types and nominal typing.
- 🛠️ Build your code using **Webpack** for efficient development.
- 🧪 Ensure quality with **Jest** for testing.

## 📂 Project Structure

This project consists of multiple tasks, each focusing on a different TypeScript feature:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **0. Creating an interface for a student** | Define an interface for a student and render it in the DOM. |
| **1. Let's build a Teacher interface** | Extend the interface with optional and custom attributes. |
| **2. Extending the Teacher class** | Create a new interface that extends an existing one. |
| **3. Printing teachers** | Write a function to print teacher details. |
| **4. Writing a class** | Create a class to represent a student with methods. |
| **5. Advanced types Part 1** | Implement teacher and director interfaces with custom methods. |
| **6. Creating functions specific to employees** | Use type predicates to handle employee types. |
| **7. String literal types** | Implement string literal types for teaching subjects. |
| **8. Ambient Namespaces** | Integrate an external library with ambient declarations. |
| **9. Namespace & Declaration merging** | Utilize declaration merging for custom namespaces. |
| **10. Update task_4/js/main.ts** | Set up subjects and teachers for real-world tasks. |
| **11. Brand convention & Nominal typing** | Apply nominal typing to ensure type safety. |

## 🛠️ Built With

- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Webpack** - JavaScript bundler for efficient builds.
- **Jest** - Testing framework for ensuring code quality.
